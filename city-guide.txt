(WATER ACTIVITY)
Nieuwe Maas river
- at night: Lights from SkyscrapersLeast favourite place in Rotterdam: There is a restaurant at the top of the Euromast, a famous observation tower. However, I would not recommend going there, as it tends to be overpriced, and the view often falls short, especially since it is cloudy most of the time.

(Places to relax)
- For relaxation and to stop thinking About all the stressing workload I visit the Spielenarr located in the region of Hamm in Hamburg. Its a little shop for boardgames and cardgames where small events about playing trading-card-games takes place. Its a nice and friendly atmosphere.
