Nieuwe Maas river
- at night: Lights from SkyscrapersLeast favourite place in Rotterdam: There is a restaurant at the top of the Euromast, a famous observation tower. However, I would not recommend going there, as it tends to be overpriced, and the view often falls short, especially since it is cloudy most of the time.
